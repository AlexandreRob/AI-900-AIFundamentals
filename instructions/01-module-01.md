## Instructions

Azure's Cognitive Services encapsulate common AI functionality that can be categorized into four main pillars: vision, speech, language, and decision. In this lab you will take a look at one of the decision services, Anomaly Detector. Anomaly Detector allows you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data. 

The takeaway of this lab is to get a general sense of how to use the portal to create and use a resource to run an application. You do not need to learn the details of the Anomaly Detector service for this course.  

1. Go to **https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-anomaly-detector/4a-exercise** and complete the steps. 
2. Once you complete the steps, you can close this window.
