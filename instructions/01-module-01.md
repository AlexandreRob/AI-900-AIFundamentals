## Instructions

Azure's Cognitive Services encapsulate common AI functionality that can be categorized into four main pillars: vision, speech, language, and decision. Let's take a look at one of the decision services, Anomaly Detector. Anomaly Detector allows you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data. 

The takeaway of this lab is to get a sense of how to use the portal to create and use a resource to run an application. You do not need to know the details of the Anomaly Detector service for this course.  

1.	Go to **https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-anomaly-detector/4a-exercise** and complete the steps. 
2. Once you complete the steps, you can close this VM.
