lab:
    title: 'Use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning'
---

## Instructions
Machine learning models are the basis for AI applications. In this lab you will take a look at Azure Machine Learning's studio portal and try out automated machine learning. Traditional machine learning model development can be complex and time-consuming. With automated machine learning, you'll accelerate the time it takes to get production-ready ML models. 

1.	Go to the Microsoft Learn module at **https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/** and complete the following units in the browser: 

- Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
- Create compute resources
- Explore data 
- Train a machine learning model 
- Deploy a model as a service 

2. Once you complete the steps, you can close this window.
